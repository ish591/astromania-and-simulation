# Underground Mining Maze Simulation 

Underground mining is used to excavate precious minerals. In this problem we aim 
to find the optimal route a mine cart may have to take to collect the minerals from each mining station present in the network.

## Testing

To run the simulation: 

```bash 
make # To build the simulator executable 
make simulate # To run the simulation
  - Enter size of maze: 10 # Prompted to enter size of maze
```

## Features
- Maze generation using Randomised DFS
- Play/Pause: Using spacebar
- Fast Forward: Using z
- Slow Motion: Using x
- Sound added on mineral collection
